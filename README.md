# Running project locally (Development)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14
- npm
- truffle
- ganache-cli

## Installation
### 1. Clone project 
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/alexvanzyl/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project.git
```

### 2. Install truffle and ganache-cli
```shell
> npm install -g truffle
> npm install -g ganache-cli
```
### 3. Install contract and client dependencies
```shell
> cd blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
> npm install
> cd client
> npm install
```

## Running project
### 1. Run `ganache-cli` in a separate terminal (_make sure to set the network ID to 5777_)
```shell
> ganache-cli -i 5777
```
### 2. Run the build script from the project root. 
This will deploy the contracts locally and copy the artifacts to the `client/src/contracts` directory.
```shell
> ./scripts/build
```
### 3. Start the client
```shell
> cd client
> npm run dev
```
Access the client at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Running test
### 1. Make sure `ganache-cli` is running in a separate terminal
```shell
> ganache-cli
```
### 2. Run `truffle test` form the project root.
```shell
> truffle test
